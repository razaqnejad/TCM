I am a programming trainer, one thing I always do is set problem sets to the students.

One of the boring part in this content is making TestCase for the questions, so I wrote this programm to automaticion it.

This program has 2 version for Windows and Linux, because I use both in my daily projects.

#How to use:

put your source file by the name code.cpp in a same directory with TCM file and run the TCM.
