I am a programming trainer, one thing I always do is seting problem sets for the students.

The most boring part in this content is making TestCase for the questions, so I wrote this programm to automaticion it.

This program has 2 version for Windows and Linux, because I use both in my daily projects.

# How to use:
put your source file by the name code.cpp in a same directory with TCM file and run the TCM.
